A NodeJS wrapper for Tuya's [cloud API](https://docs.tuya.com/en/cloudapi/cloudAPI/index.html).

## Installation
`npm i @tuyapi/cloud`

## Usage


## Development
1. Run `npm i -D`.
2. Add a file called `keys.json` with the contents
```javascript
{
  "key": "your-api-key",
  "secret": "your-api-secret"
}
```
3. Create a file called `dev.js` as a playground. Since `dev.js` is in `.gitignore`, it won't be committed.
4. To run tests, run `npm test`.
